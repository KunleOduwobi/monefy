## Setup
- Ensure you have Java installed
- Ensure you have Maven installed and variables set properly
- Ensure you have Android Studio installed (to get the Android SDK and ADB tools)
- Ensure you have the Android SDK platform tools installed and the path added to your system variables (to use ADB commands)
- Ensure you have the necessary Android SDK versions installed (to run tests on emulators)
- Ensure you have TestNG installed in your Eclipse IDE (if you want to run the tests from the IDE)
- Ensure you have NodeJS and npm installed (to install Appium)
- Ensure you have an Android device connected to your machine, or an emulator running.
- Verify that the device is connected and visible to Appium by running ``adb devices`` in the terminal.
- Clone the repo
- Do a Maven project update
- Ensure you have the latest Appium version installed, and it is started on localhost port 4723. 
<br/> To install: ``npm install -g appium@next`` 
<br/> To start server: ``appium``

## Project Structure
- Maven is used to manage all dependencies and the project build. So no need to add any jar file. You may update any dependency version as you please in the pom.xml file.
- TestNG is used as the test management tool
- All tests are extended from a platform base class where desired capabilities are set.
-- base Package/AndroidSetup Extends AppiumUtils, 

- Listeners are included in the test utils package to take screenshots and mark test status
- Tests are grouped in different suites (smoke, regression) in the testng xml files
- A Page Object Model design pattern is implemented
- An AppiumUtils file exists in the Utils folder, which keeps frequently used methods
- Test data is stored in the data.properties file
- Tests are supplied with parameters, while a data provider is also included

## Test Execution on Terminal
- If you have Maven installed on your machine, you can execute tests from Terminal with the use of the following parameters:
- -P to state the id of the test  profile. You'll the profile ID in the pom.xml file.
- -DAndroidDeviceName to state the device model name. You can find this in the About phone on your Android device.

<br/> ``mvn test -PAndroidSmokeTests -DAndroidDeviceName=SM-A525F``

## Test Execution on Eclipse
- If you prefer to run the test from Eclipse, right click on a test xml file and select Run As > TestNG Suite. This uses all the default parameters set in data.properties, which can also be updated.
- The app to be tested is picked from the AndroidAppName value in the data.properties, which is the app file name in the project

## Test Reports
- Reports for mvn tests are generated by ExtentReports and available in reports/index.html, which also includes screenshots for failed test cases
- TestNG generates reports for Eclipse tests in test-output folder, which includes a default report and a failed tests report

## Test Retry
- The number of times to retry a failed test is set in the retryLimit variable of the RetryAnalyzer.

## Framework Parameters
- NoReset: False starts a new app session, True restores last app session.
